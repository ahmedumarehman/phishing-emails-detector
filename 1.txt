Install Firebase CLI
To host your site with Firebase Hosting, you need the Firebase CLI (a command line tool).

Run the following npm command to install the CLI or update to the latest CLI version.

npm install -g firebase-tools
Doesn't work? Take a look at the Firebase CLI reference or change your npm permissions

The SDK includes Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Performance Monitoring and more. It can be added now or later.

Open a terminal window and navigate to or create a root directory for your web app

Sign in to Google
firebase login
Initiate your project
Run this command from your app's root directory:

firebase init


Deploy to Firebase Hosting
When you're ready, deploy your web app
Put your static files (e.g. HTML, CSS, JS) in your app's deploy directory (the default is 'public'). Then, run this command from your app's root directory:
